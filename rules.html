      <h1>Server Rules</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
            <h1>1 - General Rules</h1>
            1.1 - Breaking rules before they are added will not result in a ban, however breaking them
            knowingly before or after they are added will result in the heaviest punishment for breaking that rule.
            <br>
            1.2 - Staff reserve the right to ban you for no specified reason whatsoever (a.k.a off vibes).
            <br>
            1.3 - All appeals go through kotsoda. (@kotsoda on discord), please send a message request with this format:<br>
            IGN: [Your in-game name]<br>
            Reason: [Reason for getting banned]<br>
            Reason why you should be unbanned: [Text]<br>
            I don't like reading essays, so send ban appeals that are short and have actual evidence for you to get unbanned.
            <br>
            1.4 - Any major rule changes will be announced in the discord, not knowing the new rules doesn't mean you can escape liability.

        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>2 - Server Rules</h1>
            2.1 - <b>ALL</b> and I mean <b>ALL</b> client-side modifications that grant an unfair advantage<br>
            will result in a permanent ban.<br>
            Exceptions:<br>
            ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (I don't know any helpful client-side mods that could seem like cheats for newer versions, if you know of any please let me know so I can add them to this list.)
            <br>
            2.2 - Be respectful to your fellow server members, we do not tolerate hate speech of any kind.
            <br>
            2.3 - Don't spam the chat.
            <br>
            2.4 - Don't grief.
            <br>
            2.5 - Any exploits that grant an unfair advantage (for example, duping) against other players will result in a permanent ban.
            <br>
            2.6 - Follow all staff instructions within reason.
            <br>
            2.7 - Use common sense, if it feels wrong to do, don't do it. (or ask a staff member!)
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>3 - Roleplay Rules</h1>
            3.1 - You must stay in character at all times. (Unless you're speaking out-of-character or you are not in the main world.)
            <br>
            3.2 - No metagaming (using information that a character wouldn't reasonably know within the game to influence gameplay).
            <br>
            3.3 - Respect NLR (New Life Rule), after dying, you cannot remake the same character and or go back to the same town / nation and act like nothing has happened.
            <br>
            3.4 - Keep the lines between IC (In-character) and OOC (out-of-character) chat seperated.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h1>4 - Towny Rules</h1>
            4.1 - Towns and nations cannot be direct recreations of towns / countries that exist or have existed. 
            <br>
            4.2 - Towns and nations must follow the server rules. 
            <br>
